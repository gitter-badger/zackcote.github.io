==========

This is the codebase for my personal site, built using my [jekyll-kit](https://github.com/zackcote/jekyll-kit), an opinionated jekyll setup using [jeet](), [rupture](), [stylus](), [gulp]().

This codebase is incidentally very representative of my personal coding style and best practices. If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up @zackcote_ or here on github.
