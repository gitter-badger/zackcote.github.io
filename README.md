This is the source of my personal site, built using my [jekyll-kit](https://github.com/zackcote/jekyll-kit), an opinionated jekyll setup using [jeet](), [rupture](), [stylus](), and [gulp]().

I mostly use it for blogging and a portfolio, just so I have some semblance of a web presence.

This codebase is incidentally very representative of my personal coding style and best practices. If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up [@zackcote_](https://twitter.com/zackcote_) or here on github.
