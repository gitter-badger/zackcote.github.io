####Overview
Baywood designs and sells unique wooden sunglasses out of Newport, RI. I met the owner Jim on Reddit when he [shared Baywood with r/providence](http://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/23fjlf/welcome_to_baywood_a_newport_based_wood_and/). In early 2014 Baywood enlisted me to help them with a total product relaunch.

####The Problem
Jim's sunglasses company was doing great in the boutiques of Newport, but his online storefront was struggling. Baywood's existing site was based on a free template and suffered from usability issues and struggled to keep users engaged throughout the checkout process.

####The Solution
I rebuilt Baywoodgear.com from the ground up with an emphasis on useability and consistiency. Jim now has a resilient platform for his business that will grow alongside his customer base.
