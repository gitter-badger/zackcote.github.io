2014 was a busy year of client work, and I've finally found the time to launch my portfolio. There's an ethos in the development world to 'ship it, fix it' based on the idea that a piece of software is never *truly* done. There is always room for improvement. This site is no different, and I look forward to making improvements and design tweaks as the year progresses.

I feel similarly about personal growth.

Now that I've 'shipped' myself and zackcote.com, I'm hoping that this will become a place for me to grow as a developer and as a human. Last year was a breakthrough for my business in that **I turned down more clients than I accepted**. As a result the quality of my work has only risen, and I was able to foster strong relationships with some key clients. Highlights of 2014 include:

- A comprehensive redesign of [eyeforsound.com](http://zackcote.com/case-study/eye-for-sound) for Serj Tankian of System of a Down.
- The launch of [baywoodgear.com](http://zackcote.com/case-study/baywood) to tremendous sales and additional product launches.
- Contributed to open-source projects like **Jeet** and **html5blank** on [GitHub.](https://github.com/zackcote)
- Wrote a report and gave a presentation to Wheeler School stakeholders on their CMS and fundraising software, as well as migrating their camp management software to a superior choice.

This year, I'm looking for a new experience as I **take my skills to an agency**. I'm currently in the application process for a full-time position. If you're an employer, check out my [Resume & Hiring Info](/hire) for consideration. I'm looking forward to it.
