    How I built a resilent new platform for Serj Tankian.
---

####Overview
Eye for Sound is a unique platform that connects visual art and music through technology. Eye for Sound is the brainchild of grammy-winning musician and artist Serj Tankian, of *System of a Down*. A member of Serj's team referred him to me to build a speedy and responsive site for Eye for Sound.

####The Problem
The Eye for Sound team had great success with their mobile apps, but needed a promotional site to increase downloads and as a platform to sell original artwork.

####The Solution
I built Eye for Sound a streamlined responsive website using Wordpress and the Big Cartel ecommerce platform. Serj has seen increased sales to his artwork and increased app downloads.
